    - title: Welcome to The Mando Xd Nation Community

      description: >
        Welcome to The Mando Xd Nation Community, the official community Discord server for The Cuddles Project and many more.


        The Cuddles Project is an open-source, community-driven bot toolchain designed primarily for Discord.
        By focusing on speed, ease of use and modularity, we aim to provide a sleek and modern experience for all our
        toolchain/collab servers and people who get chosen to use our bots.


        This is a project that was born out of a need for change in the discord botting ecosystem. Our teams contain
        many experienced members of the developing community, providing a level of familiarity that helps us to avoid the
        mistakes of the past – whether those mistakes relate to community management, diversity and inclusivity, project
        governance or transparency.


        Before you get started, **please make sure to review our [rules](https://quiltmc.org/community) and
        [Code of Conduct](https://quiltmc.org/community/code-of-conduct).** We also recommend taking a look at our
        [guide for newcomers](https://quiltmc.org/about/newcomer-guide/).


        Additionally, remember that you can self-assign roles and manage which channels are visible by clicking on
        <id:customize>, or the **Channels & Roles** option at the top of the channel list.


        We hope you enjoy your time with us!

      References to media with sexual or disturbing themes – profiles are okay for this one.

    🎨 Respect personal projects and creative work.: >
      Don't pester developers (especially me) for bot updates or to make a custom one for you (they have their own lives!), steal art / steal code / etc. without permission, or use Ai (See below for more on our Ai policy!)

    🤖 Do not use generative AI content.: >
      This is only because we want you to make art that is actually yours! Not ai generated or something like that. Please if you want to share something
      made by ai, make sure to tell us. 🌟

      Loud or eye-straining media – unless labelled with sound/eye-strain warnings
      Excessive roleplay
      Misinformation; you must have an up-to-date, reliable source for any information you share.

    ❤️‍🩹 Don’t vent publicly, especially regarding heavy themes.: >
      We understand and empathise with how rough life is sometimes, but users are not professionals and are not qualified to help you.

    🍵 Take care of yourself and encourage healthy behaviour.: >
      Don't make self-deprecating comments, and don't glorify or enable self-destructive behaviour (e.g. not sleeping/eating enough).
      Do and speak what is best for yourself and others.

    💌 Message manager is enabled.: >
      Any messages sent, edited, and deleted are logged by xelA for moderation and debugging purposes, so please don't think you can send a silly message and then us moderators can't find out... because we can :P
